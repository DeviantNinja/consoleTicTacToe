Simple Tic Tac Toe Game First Project on the road to learning. Im sure there is alot wrong with it. but it works 

What did i learn?
applied some basic control structuctures and variables tried to follow the single use principle by creating many smaller methods that do one thing instead of many. also tried to follow a very simple MVC pattern where the logic and game baord are not dependant on each other.


What do i think i need to change?
the game loop controls some of the player details like whos turn is it. this should probally be included in the game logic. could change this by moving the player details into the TicTacToeLogic class and using getters and setters to retrieve the information

i used alot of magical numbers/characters could define these as final variables to save needign to update them in many places.
